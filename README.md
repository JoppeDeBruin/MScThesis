# MScThesis

This respository contains the code to reproduce the results and figures in my MSc thesis "Topics in Conformal Prediction"

Except for installing the necessary dependencies, all scripts should be runnable by simply including the utils.R file in the working directory. Note that some simulations have the option to parallelize over multiple cores. This feature only works on Linux machines and can cause trouble on Windows.
